# l4proxy

## Description

l4proxy is used to export services on non static ip hosts by a public host. For example you can export sshd/vnc/3389 service in your homelab by a vps using l4proxy.

## Features

* l4 reverse proxy.
* API to list connected clients and backend users.
* load balance for same backend service on different host.

## Architecture

The following is how different components are connected together. SSH service is used as an example.

```
+-backend user-+      +---public host------+   +------protected host 1----------+ 
| +----------+ |      | +--------------+   |   |   +--------------+      +----+ |
| |ssh client| | <--> | |l4proxy server| <-+-+-+-> |l4proxy client| <--> |sshd| |
| +----------+ |      | +--------------+   | | |   +--------------+      +----+ |
+--------------+      +--------------------+ | +--------------------------------+ 
                                             | +------protected host 2----------+
                                             | |   +--------------+      +----+ |
                                             +-+   |l4proxy client| <--> |sshd| |
                                               |   +--------------+      +----+ |
                                               +--------------------------------+
```

One (backend user <--> l4proxy server) connection is mapped to one (l4proxy server <--> l4proxy client) connection.
Each client will connect to a seperate internal socket.
A public control port is required, and two addition ports for each client.

## Build

```
git clone https://github.com/winglq/l4proxy
cd l4proxy
make bin # linux
make win # windows
```

## Usage

Create l4proxy server.

```
l4proxy server --host your_ip
```

Create l4proxy client.

```
l4proxy client --svr_addr your_ip 127.0.0.1 backend_service_port
```

Use --int_port and --pub_port in l4proxy client to specify the listen port on l4proxy server, make sure a tcp rule is added to the firewall to allow connection on these ports.

For more detail usage use `l4proxy -h`.

## To do

1. unit tests reqired.
2. CI.
3. integration tests.
4. shared internal port between different clients.
5. error handling.
6. rate limit support
7. web ?
